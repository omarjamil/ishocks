Just some definitions; see Numerical Recipes for details.

Nyquist frequency = 1/2*Time span = 1/2T
where time span (T) = t_max - t_min

Number of freq. points returned = 0.5 * ofac * hifac * N

Oversampling factor (ofac) is typically 4 or above.

f_c = N/2T = N*Nyquist frequency
High frequency factor (hifac) = hi_freq/f_c
