                        point, evolves with adiabatic losses)      

nu_min =                Min freq for the range of spectrum obtained
nu_max =                Max freq for the range of spectrum obtained
nu_points =             number of grid points for the range of frequency; logarithmic grid.

individual_frequencies  1=true, 0 = false; When true only the nu_1 and nu_2
nu_1 =                  first frequency (Hz)
nu_2 =                  second frequency (Hz)
data_file =             Name of the data file to read; Used for
                        lightcurce data. Give file extension as well.

increase_time_resolution       1=true, 0 =false; when true, there is
                               increased sampling. Unlike moving from
                               "event" to "event" when false.       
step_resolution =              time step resolution when above true [s]
total_run_duration =           total run time for the simuation when
                               above true[s]

avg_ejection_time =     Average time gap between shell ejection [s]
shell_inj_duration = 	Duration the shells are injected for; This will
                        determine how far the shells will get to
			in the jet and hence the final size of the
                        jet. Used if use_shell_file = false.
                        [s]
                        
use_shell_file =        1=true, 0 =false; When true the model reads
                        shell properties (injection time, mass, BLF, length) from a file.
shell_file =            The name of the file to read the above
                        properties from.

use_data_file =         1=true, 0 =false; When true the model reads an
                        X-ray light curve and produces a shell_file
                        with the above name to be read the model.          
data_file =             Name of the X-ray lightcurve file.            
results_file = 		Name of results file to be written. Give file extension as well.

in_vacuum_expansion =   1=true, 0=false; This means no work is done by
                        the lateral expansion of the
                        jet. This will only re-calculate the power-law
                        normalisation and magnetic energy density
                        based on new volume rather than have energy
                        losses.

inj_int_energy =        1=true, 0=false; Inject the shells with
                        internal energy.
rel_mass_frac =         Fraction of shell rest mass energy to be the
                        internal energy (1=100%)

shock_location =        Location of the shock i.e. location where the
                        shells are energized. Allows to explore single
                        shock zone model.
                        [light seconds]

slow_energization =     1=true, 0=false. Energize shells depending on
                        the shock crossing time. For mergers only.
